COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION



   CTE is a temporary result set that you can define within a query to simplify complex sql statement 


   Once CTE has been created,it can only be used once , I will not be persisted.

   The command below I have executed is an single command although it has many lines ,but it is consider as a single command , see where used ; to know

   syntax

      WITH cte_name (optional_column_list) AS (

            ...CTE query
            SELECT ...
)

      ... Main query referencing the CTE
      SELECT ...
      FROM cte_name
      WHERE ...;
